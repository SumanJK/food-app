## End Notes

In this project we tried to me the clone of the pluralsight wesite as close to real one by using all the technical skills that we have learned up until now. We tried making it using HTML, CSS, Javascripts. We have also created the backend part of this website which is use for authentication as well as storing & seaching data of the couses. The search keywords is passed to the backend inorder to get keywords related results. Workflow is not the same as original. We tried our best to clone it.








## Some Important Notes

To make the payment check pass you need to enter any 12 digit no. in the card section.


## Limitations

All the page are not responsible. Workflow is also different than orginal.
